# x16-blinkenlights

# x16-invention-13

I was missing Bach's "Invention 13", and so here's the first 13 bars that Commodore Business Machines used in the early 80s for Commodore product promotions.

The file to run is DEMO-INVENTION13.BAS

It has X-16 sprites, and mimics the old sales pitch for the C64.

# x16-kernal-test
A little C program that tests KERNAL routines.

# x16-robsos
